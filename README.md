## Tutorial on deploying machine learning model 

A tutorial in deploying machine learning models. 


### Project status: 
Uncomplete, project on hold to understand other software engineering process. 

Went on to figure out RESTFUL api and how to use flask in deploying models.



### Reflection: 

Honestly, I have almost no experience in the process outside of working in jupyter notebooks. This course is extremely helpful in giving me some insights into the process outside of the research environment into the deployment environment.


Concept of 

1) Creating the pipeline from preprocessing to prediction
 
2) Virual environment 

3) Logging the predictions

4) Testing using pytest 

5) Packaging the trained model 

I had difficulty in keeping up serving the model via REST api and using flask and put the tutorial on hold to study and learn flask.
